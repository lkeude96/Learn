# Panning

* ### Looking at the three main panning areas
  * One of the most taken-for-granted elements in mixing pertains to the placement of sound element in the stereo field, otherwise known as panning
  * Three main field:
    * Hard left
    * Hard right
    * Center
  * We don't usually pan kick drums and basses.
  * Where panning does come in handy though is when we do something like panning  the vocals or panning other instruments to stay out of the way of certain instruments.
  * sometimes a hard left/hard right pan doesn't really work well for a lot of stereo instruments. Try modest pan which will feel more natural.
  * The most prominent music element is usually panned to the center, as well as the kick, bass and even snare because this makes the mix feel strong and anchored.

* ### Panning the drums
  * Two ways to pan drums
    * From the audience's perspective (90% of producers does this)
    * from the drummer's perspective
  * Pan overheads hard left and right
  * Pan toms around 30% and floor tom around 60%
  * Pan hi hat right 40ish %
  * More space -> less power
  * don't alway have to pan the kick wide

* ### Avoiding pseudo-stereo
  * Most synths and virtual instruments have some sort of pseudo-stereo effect that makes instrument sound lager than it really is when panned hard left and right
  * When we have more and more stereo instruments that are panned hard left and right we have a condition called "big mono"
  * Big mono means everything is in the same place and we're not utilizing the stereo field.
  * The beauty of having a stereo is the fact that we can put each instruments in it own little part of the stereo soundscape
