# Building Your Mix

* ### Learning the principles of building a mix
  * The essence of mixing is the balance between instruments or mix elements
  * There are a number of places to start our mix from
  * There's no right or wrong way to build a mix
  * The mix bus level will get louder with every instrument entrance
  * Begin our mix with the mix bus meter reading at about -10dB
  * The sound of every drum will change when a new drum or cymbal is added to the mix due to the leakage of the other drums into the mic

* ### Assigning the drums to a subgroup
  * Whenever there are two or more instruments in a mix element like a drum-kit, it's best to assign them to a subgroup in order to make any level adjustments easier.
  * Put all drums volume down
  * First, insert a subgroup(stereo) after the last channel that's in the group that we want to put in that subgroup.
  * Rename it accordingly (Put it in caps to make it easier to differentiate to other channels)
  * Route (i/o) the audio from your individual channels to the subgroup (Shift + click select all of them to make it faster)  

* ### Building the mix from the kick
  * Many mixers like to build their drum mix from the bass drum, because it's part of the foundation of the song.
  * First raise the kick volume up
    * If we have a low kick, just bring it up enough where we can barely hear it
    * After raising volume for kick, master's around -10dB on peak
  * Bring the snare up to the same relative level to the kick
    * If we have a snappy snare (bottom mic) in addition to the snare that we have (top snare), bring it up till we can barely hear it
    * Master is at about -7dB now
  * Next we bring the overhead mics up just till we can hear the cymbals
  * Now we're going to bring the toms up
    * Toms changes the sound of the entire drum kit
    * Bring the middle tom up first(we can kinda hear the ring of the tom)
    * Bring the other ones up
    * Bring the floor tom up
    * It's not going to sound as clean as we might thing
    * Now we go to a place in the song where there's a lot of toms fills already and find a place where you can balance all of them together to about the same level(not too loud not too quiet)
  * Bring the hat just loud enough where we can hear that definition happen
  * Room mic
  * Master is at almost 0dB highest point and that's why having a subgroup is useful when mixing we'll be able to control the level using this one fader

* ### Building the mix from the snare
  * The snare drum is the pulse of the song, which is why so many mixers like to build their drum mix around it
  * Bring the snare up till it reads about -10dB on the master channel
  * Now we bring in the kicks to about the same level relatively speaking to how we hear them
  * Bring the overheads in just enough to hear the cymbals
  * bring in the toms
  * now the hats
  * room mic (Makes it sound bigger and fuller. Adds some glue to the drums. Give us some ambience)

* ### Building the mix from the toms
  * Many mixers feel that when they build their mix from the kick or snare, the tom fills get lost when they enter the song.
  * First try to balance our toms and group them
  * Next kick to about the same levels as the toms
  * Same for the snares
  * Now the overhead to be able to hear the cymbals
  * bring the hats to define them
  * and now the room mics

* ### Building the mix from the overhead mics
  * Overhead mics are placed further away from the cymbals then normal cymbal miking, and they are meant to pick up the overall sound of the drum kit
  * the bigger the room the better using an overhead mic work
  * First we bring the overheads up until the master channels is about -10dB
  * Every time we bring a piece of the drum kit in, we're trying to make more defined, not necessarily trying to put it out in front of the overhead sound.
  * Overheads -> Kick -> Snare -> Toms -> Hats -> Room
  * It's a completely different sound than when we started from kick, snare or toms for instance

* ### Checking the drum phase
  * One of the most important yet overlooked parts of the drum mix is checking the phase of the drums.
  * Out-of-phase channel suck the low end out of a mix
  * Two reason a channel can be out of phase
    * Mis-wired cables
    * Two mics very close to listening to the exact same sound source
  * Go through all the channels and flip the phase and select the position with the most low end

* ### Balancing direct and miked bass channels
  * Bass amp used to be mic'd. Today, most basses are taken direct
  * DI is generally going to have more high end, and mic'd base cabinet is going to be more fuller and rounder
  * When we add them together, we get a combination that sounds better than either one, but not always
  * Two ways to figure out the correct balance
    * Raise DI and gradually bring the bass cabinet in until we get the fullness that we need
    * Listen in the track what the bass sounds like first the DI then bring in the bass cabinet
  * Choose the one that sounds best in the track and add the other to taste

* ### Building the mix from the bass
  * In the 50s 60 and 70s, the bass was the foundation of the songs, not the drums.
  * Bring bass level up around -10 on master mix
  * Bring up the kick so they're about the same level.(Master mix increase about 3dB)
  * Bass -> Kick -> Snare -> Overheads -> Toms -> Hats -> Room

* ### Building the mix from the vocals
  * Sometimes since the vocal is usually the most important element in the mix, the entire mix should be built around it.
  * Bring vocal level up to around -10 on master mix
  * Never want to make the other drums louder than the vocal
  * Bass to about same level with kick
  * Vocal -> Kick -> Snare -> Overheads -> Toms -> Hats -> Room -> Bass
  * By bringing the vocals in first, we make sure that it's the center of attention and it never gets buried in the mix

* ### Balancing the rhythm section
  * The balance between the bass and the drums is critical because it provides the power of the mix. (the key is to make the bass, kick and snare work together)
  * Mute and listen to the bass, Bring the bass to about -10 on master mix
  * Unmute kick and snare make sure all three are at about the same level.
  * Now unmute all the other drums and make sure we're able to hear the kick snare and bass distinctly

* ### Balancing the rest of the instruments with the rhythm section
  * After the rhythm section is balanced, it's time to add the rest of the instruments
  * Bring the instruments in just at a level we can hear them so we don't over power the rhythm section
  * Keyboards -> Guitars -> Vocals -> Background Vocals -> Tambourine
  * Vocals are up from / loudest in typical pop mix

* ### Making a mix without building it
  * Bring all faders up
  * gradually balance every using intuition
  * When mixing like this master mix meters might peak

* ### Balancing the harmony vocals
  * With harmony vocals, the balance is crucial in order to get the correct blended impact
  * Start from lowest vocal to highest
  * Higher vocals tend to cut through the mix easier then lower ones
