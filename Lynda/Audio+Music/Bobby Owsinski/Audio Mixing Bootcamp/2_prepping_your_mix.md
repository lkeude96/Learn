# Prepping Your Mix

* ### Setting up your session
  * Make a copy of the file and rename it
  * Delete tracks that don't have audio in them
  * Make tracks we aren't going to use inactive / hide
  * Group everything that needs to be together/ every likes tracks
  * Make sure each tracks have descriptive name
  * Color code all of our tracks

* ### Setting up your subgroups
  * Groups / subgroups allows us to group similar elements of the mix so we can make adjustments by instruments sections rather individually
  * Group links multiple tracks together
  * Subgroups allows you to have a dedicated channel which multiple tracks are routed to. This allows us to apply effects on multiples instruments at the same time.
  
* ### Setting up your effects
  * Mixes goes a lot faster when we setup our effects before we began to mix
  * Setup 2 reverb send/ aux (usually stereo):
    * Short reverb -> Snares, Toms
      * Usually short reverb are added to the drums (specially snares)
      * Start with a small room
      * Decay at about 1.5 sec
      * Pre delay at about 20 ms (On set of where the reverb actually starts)
    * Long reverb -> Guitars, Organs
      * We'll start with a plate reverb
      * Decay at about 2 sec
      * 20 ms of Pre delay
  * Setup 2 delay send/aux (usually mono):
    * Short delay -> Vocals
      * Delay at about 175 ms (favorite of Paul McCartney)
      * Feedback at about 4 %
    * Long delay -> Background Vocals
      * Delay ~ 300 ms
      * Feedback 4 %
