# Improving Your Listening Environment

* ### Determining the listening position
  * The place that provide the best acoustic performance will almost always come setting up length-wise in the room
  * The speakers should be firing the long way down the room
  * Every room suffers from reflection that reenforce at 50% point of the room and diminish at the 25% and 75% point
  * We should place the speakers somewhere between 25% 50% or 75% point of the room, on point that is odd, non divisible number like 27, 38(preferred by many acoustic designers), or 45

* ### Fixing acoustic problems
  * Avoid placing the speakers up against the wall (at least 12 inch)
  * Avoid the corners of the room
  * Avoid being closer to one wall of the room than the other (symmetry is essential to keep a balanced stereo image with a stable frequency response in the room)
  * Avoid different types of walls absorption
  * Make sure to place speakers on stands

* ### Setting up your monitors
  * Check the distance between the monitors (they should be as far apart as they are distanced to the listening position)
  * Try to make an equilateral triangle between you and the two monitors (67.5 inches is the ideal distance)
  * Check the angles of the monitors (Focal point preferred 3 to 4 inches behind head)
    * The focal point is where the sound from the tweeters converges
  * Mount a mirror over each tweeters and adjust the speakers so your face can be seen in both mirrors at the same time
  * If we're putting monitors on desk, we need to place them on a piece of open cell neoprene
  * Check how the monitors parameters are set and set them the same on each monitors
  * If the speakers are designed to be laid on their side make sure the tweeters are on the outside because the stereo field is widened
  * Make sure speakers are head height
