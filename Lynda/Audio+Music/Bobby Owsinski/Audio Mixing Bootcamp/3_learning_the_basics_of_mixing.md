# Learning the Basics of Mixing

* ### Developing the groove
  * Our mix will never sound as good as it can unless the groove of the song is emphasized.
  * The groove is the pulse of the song
  * Every kind of music as a groove
  * To find the groove of a song ask those two questions:
    * What instruments provide the pulse of the song?
    * What makes the groove stand out?
* ### Emphasizing the most important elements
  * Every song has some element that acts like a hook to capture the listener's attention
  * Many times it's the vocal, but it can be other elements as well
  * It's an element so important that the song wouldn't be the same without it.
    * Example:
      * The piano in Coldplay's "**Clocks**"
      * The clavinet in Stevie Wonder's "**Superstition**"
      * The intro guitar line in Rolling Stones' "**Satisfaction**"
  * Finding the most important mix element is vital for a great mix
    * In a dance song might be the kick
    * In a RnB song it could be the groove
    * In a pop song it might be the hook or an instrument that plays in the intro of the interlude

* ### Knowing what to avoid
  * Avoid a mix that has no contrast / no texture (when the same ambient texture is used like same level of reverb used for every instrument)
  * Avoid a mix that has no focal point (when there's nothing to hold the listener's attention)
  * Avoid a mix that's noisy (clicks, hums, extraneous noises, count-offs, and sometimes lip-smacks and breaths)
  * Avoid a mix that lack clarity and punch (instruments aren't distinct)
  * Avoid a mix that sounds distant (too much reverb and other effects)
  * Avoid a mix where the elements level are inconsistent
  * Avoid a mix where the sounds are dull and uninteresting
